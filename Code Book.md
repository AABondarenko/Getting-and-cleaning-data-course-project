The columns in the tidy data set "new_data":

  - *subject* - An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
  - *activity* - Names of activities performed by each person.

Other variables came from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ.
The body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ).
signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
